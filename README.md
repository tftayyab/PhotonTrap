# üöÄ PhotonTrap ‚Äî Black Hole Visualizer (Work in Progress)

**PhotonTrap** is an interactive web app that helps users explore the fascinating physics of black holes. Enter a black hole‚Äôs mass and see how its event horizon size, gravitational effects, and light bending work ‚Äî all visualized with animations and simple explanations.

> üöß This project is under development as I learn to combine physics, math, and web animation for a unique space-themed experience.
